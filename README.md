# Data_analyst_assignments
This project showcases a collection of assignments focused on data analysis and visualization using popular tools such as Microsoft Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Tableau. The assignments cover various scenarios and datasets to demonstrate different analytical techniques and visualization approaches.
Key Features:
Power BI: In the Power BI section, we have created interactive dashboards that showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, revenue, and customer demographics. The visualizations allow users to slice and dice data to gain deeper insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.

Tableau: The Tableau analysis complements the Power BI dashboards, providing additional visualizations and a different perspective on store performance. The Tableau dashboards offer intuitive data exploration, making it easier to identify trends and correlations within the dataset.

Excel Functions: In the Excel section, we have used various functions to clean and transform raw data, perform calculations, and create insightful reports. Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, and PivotTables were utilized to generate meaningful summaries and visualizations.
